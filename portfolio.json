    "title": "CAB203 Coin Betting Algorithm",
    "description": "This project is an assignment for CAB203, focusing on implementing algorithms for making bets on coin flips. The Python script includes a text censoring function and a betting strategy function based on previous outcomes and odds. The betting function uses a probabilistic approach to decide whether to bet on heads, tails, or not to bet, in a series of coin flips, aiming to maximize profit. ",
